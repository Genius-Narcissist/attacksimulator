AttackSimulator
Cybersecurity Simulation & Risk Assessment Platform
AttackSimulator is a cybersecurity awareness and risk-assessment platform that simulates real-world cyber attacks such as phishing, credential harvesting, and social engineering.

The platform allows organizations to safely test how employees respond to cyber threats and provides analytics to identify security vulnerabilities.

Instead of relying on theoretical cybersecurity training, AttackSimulator creates controlled simulations of real attacks, tracks employee behavior, and generates actionable insights for organizations.

Problem Statement
Cyber attacks today frequently exploit human behavior instead of system vulnerabilities.

Common threats include:

Phishing Emails
Credential Harvesting
Social Engineering
Business Email Compromise (BEC)
Organizations struggle to measure employee preparedness because most cybersecurity awareness programs rely on:

Generic training videos
Security workshops
Online courses
These approaches fail to simulate real-world attack scenarios and therefore do not accurately measure employee response behavior.

Additionally, enterprise solutions like KnowBe4 and Proofpoint are expensive, making them inaccessible for smaller organizations.

Solution
AttackSimulator provides a controlled cyber attack simulation platform that allows organizations to safely test and improve their security posture.

The platform:

Simulates cyber attacks
Tracks employee responses
Provides analytics dashboards
Delivers instant training after failures
The goal is to transform theoretical training into practical cybersecurity defense experience.

Key Features
Phishing Simulation
Create realistic phishing campaigns targeting employees across departments.

Attack Engine
Simulates multiple cyber attack vectors including:

Email phishing
Credential harvesting
Social engineering
Malware simulations
Real-Time Tracking
Tracks employee behavior such as:

Email opens
Link clicks
Credential submission attempts
Attack reports
Analytics Dashboard
Provides insights such as:

Click rate
Credential submission rate
Reporting rate
Department risk score
Security Awareness Training
If an employee fails a simulation, the platform provides immediate educational feedback and training modules.

Role-Based Access
Different dashboards for:

Admin
Analyst
Defender
Employee
Behavioral Risk Analysis
Tracks employee security behavior patterns to identify high-risk users.

System Architecture
AttackSimulator follows a three-layer architecture:

1. Attack Engine
Responsible for launching simulated cyber attacks such as phishing emails and tracking employee interactions.

2. Analysis Engine
Processes simulation data and generates analytics including risk scores, infection maps, and kill-chain replay.

3. Awareness Engine
Provides personalized training modules and security awareness education based on user behavior.

Technology Stack
Frontend
React
Vite
TailwindCSS
Chart.js
Recharts
ReactFlow (infection map)
Backend
Node.js
Express.js
Database
MongoDB
Authentication
JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
APIs & Services
SendGrid (email simulation)
Socket.io (real-time updates)
Platform Modules
Authentication System
Secure login system with role-based access control.

Campaign Management
Admins can create and manage attack simulations.

Email Simulation Engine
Simulates phishing emails and tracks user interactions.

Event Tracking System
Records employee actions during simulations.

Analytics Dashboard
Displays real-time cybersecurity metrics and insights.

Awareness Training System
Automatically provides training when employees fail a simulation.

User Flow
Administrator logs into the dashboard
Admin creates a phishing simulation campaign
System sends simulated attack emails
Employees interact with emails
System tracks actions such as clicks or credential attempts
Analytics dashboard displays results
Example Simulation Results
Example campaign analytics:

Emails Sent: 200
Emails Opened: 140
Links Clicked: 60
Credentials Attempted: 20
Phishing Reported: 30
These insights help organizations identify security weaknesses and high-risk employees.

Security Considerations
AttackSimulator is designed with strict safety measures:

Real credentials are never stored
Form fields are wiped before submission
Simulations run in a controlled environment
Data is anonymized for analytics
This ensures employees can safely interact with simulated attacks without compromising real security.

Business Model
AttackSimulator can operate as a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform.

Possible revenue streams include:

Monthly subscription plans
Premium analytics dashboards
Corporate cybersecurity training services
Enterprise simulation packages
Target customers include:

Enterprises
IT security teams
Educational institutions
Government organizations
Challenges Faced
During development the team faced several challenges:

Designing realistic phishing simulations
Ensuring credentials are never stored
Implementing secure authentication
Creating accurate behavioral analytics
Designing intuitive dashboards
These were addressed through careful system design and secure data handling practices.

Future Scope
Future improvements may include:

AI-based phishing email generation
Machine learning risk prediction
Integration with corporate email systems
Advanced threat simulation scenarios
Automated security awareness training
These enhancements can make AttackSimulator a full cybersecurity awareness ecosystem.
